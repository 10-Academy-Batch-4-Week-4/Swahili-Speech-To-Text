# Swahili-Speech-To-Text
Speech recognition technology allows for hands-free control of smartphones, speakers, and even vehicles in a wide variety of languages. Companies have moved towards the goal of enabling machines to understand and respond to more and more of our verbalized commands. There are many matured speech recognition systems available, such as Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Appleâ€™s Siri. However, all of those voice assistants work for limited languages only. 

 
The intelligent systems in the app are expected to live to transcribe the speech-to-text and organize the information in an easy-to-process way in a database. 

You work for the Tenacious data science consultancy, which is chosen to deliver speech-to-text technology for two languages: Amharic and Swahili. Your responsibility is to build a deep learning model that is capable of transcribing a speech to text. The model you produce should be accurate and is robust against background noise.
